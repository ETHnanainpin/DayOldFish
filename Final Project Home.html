	  <!--This web page refers to games that are popular or that I like. There should be 3 planned pages then maybe we can add more.-->
	<h1>Games</h1>
	<p>This site will talk about many of the great games that have held a large player base for a lasting time and many of my favorite games. This is to document game history for the future.</p>
	
  <p> 2010-2020 and 2021 has been the best decade for games since the first video game media outrage before the 2000s. Many great games came out and affected popular culture for years to come. Many examples of this is <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Syrim</i> and <i>Grand Theft Auto 5</i>. Both games came out at the turn of the decade, yet they have been popular through media and both have a very loyal player base still today. </p>
