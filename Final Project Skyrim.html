	<h1>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h1>
  
  </div>
	<p><i>Skrim</i> is an open world rpg that was released on November 11, 2011. It is the fifth game in the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> franchise which was already widely popular with gamers, though none of the previous games had so much success. This can be attributed to a much wealthier developer, an already loyal player base, and more media coverage. So when <i>Skyrim</i> first came out it drew people in because it was the largest game of its type to ever be realeased. It had the largest world map, a great pick your own story type of campaign, and also a fascinating and lore filled world to explore. In fact to this day all the secrets from the game haven't been discorvered or disciphered. </p>

  <h3>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition</h3>
  <p> The game recieved many updates and dlc to the game that allowed it to have a longer active player lifespan and years later the developers rereleased Skyrim as <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition</i>. The Special Edition came with a lot more, DLC and more quests, and most importantly mods. When they opened up mods that people can make then release to the public to freely download and experiment with, they no longer had to continue updating every year or month. They used the fanbase to expand the game for themselves and even on the home page of the game they added a easy to use sponsored mod list that people can access and use. To this day the game is supported and expanded upon by the community and played by the community.  </p>

<h3> Game List in the Elder Scrolls Series according to <a href="https://www.greenmangaming.com/the-elder-scrolls-hub/a-history-of-the-elder-scrolls-series/">Green Man Gaming</a></h3>

<ul>
    <li> <i>The Elder Scrolls Arena</i> is the first of the games in the Elder Scrolls series and is mainly a arena game that quickly escalates to lead you along a path of exciting quests and adventures to save the Empire! </li>
    <li><i>The Elder Scrolls Daggerfall</i> is a iconic game in the fanchise becasue it was the first game to truly build the way the world of Tamriel will be built.</li>
    <li><i>The Elder Scrolls Battlespire</i> focused on the demonic threat that has come to Tamriel and makes it your mission to save the world. This game is unlike the others becasue it isn't open world and instead is a dungeon crawl.</li>
    <li><i>The Elder Scrolls Redgaurd</i> is similar to some other story based open world games, instead of being able to customize your character with any other the numerous cultures the franchise has to offer, you start as a Redgaurd immediately and go on a quest to save your sister.</li>
    <li><i>The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind</i> is when the game really got outlandish, no longer is it being playing in the desert or plains, now it is being palyed in a volcannic landscape with all sorts of new wild life dotting the landscape. It has tons of freedom and is one of  the best rated games in the franchise </li>
    <li><i>The Elder Scrolls Travels</i> is the first mobile phone game that had a lot of flaws but was a nice addition and look into the Elder Scrolls universe that excited new players.</li>
    <li><i>The Elder Scrolls Oblivion</i> is probably the second most popular single player game in the franchise behind Skyrim. This game returns to the roots of the franchise where <i>Arena</i> first took place. The new graphics and game designs made the game much better and a very well made open world game. </li>
    <li><i>The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim</i>, the best rated game in the franchise and a culmination of everything the franchise has developed leading into an exciting action and lore packed adventure for both new and old players. </li>
    <li><i>The Elder Scrolls Online</i> is the first MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Play Game) and was a great hit. Impossible to compare with the single player games because of the many differences in game design it is also one of the best MMORPGs ever made. There is tons of lore and it has the full expanse of the contenant of Tamriel and beyond. </li>
    <li><i>The Elder Scrolls Legends</i> is a card game that uses many characters and factions from all of the games. </li>
