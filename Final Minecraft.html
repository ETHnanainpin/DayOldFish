	<h1>Minecraft</h1>
	<p>Minecraft came out in Nov 18, 2011 and is developed in Java. Minecraft is a block game that originated as a first person single player game. There wasn't much at the start either. Over years at Swedish company Mojang Studios (its original developer) it advanced many leaps and bounds slowly building a larger player base. When multiplayer was added and expanded upon it made it just that much better for people to play.

	<p>There are many things you can do in minecraft because it is a sandbox game and so much more you can do when playing it with others. That is what makes the came so loved by so many.</p>

<p>Minecraft is a unique first person sandbox game that has a significant player base. </p>
		<p>In 2009, Markus Persson seated  himself at his computer to create a new video game, one he had been thinking about for a long period of time. Day after day he coded and shaped this game, and he finally was satisfied with the start of it. "Cavegame", as he called it, was enjoyed by himself and his friends. After some updates to his game, Markus changed the name to "Minecraft." Little did he know that he was creating the best selling and most popular game of all time.</p>
		<p>On September 15, 2014, a large technology corporation known as Microsoft bought Minecraft from Markus for 2.5 billion dollars. Unfortunately, in 2016, Minecraft lost a lot of popularity due to issues with the community. That all changed when popular content creators PewDiePie, Keemstar, and CallMeCarson made dedicated series' and events on Minecraft. In 2019, the game's popularity skyrocketed, which shocked many people as most games which lose popularity stay that way. This sparked others to start playing the game again. Minecraft was born again.</p>
		<p>Minecraft is still one of the most played games, and there are many new content creators modifying the game. They challenge to make it more difficult to beat the game. Some notable content creators, such as Dream, created a fun challenge called Minecraft Manhunt. In Minecraft Manhunt, a player has to beat the game while someone else tries to stop the player. New life was brought to the game by many people, and to this day, Minecraft is still surging in popularity.</p>
