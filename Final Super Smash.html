	<h1>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</h1>
	
	<p id="para_1">Smash ultimate is probably one of the if not  the most popular installments in the smash franchise. It’s popularity can partially be attributed to it being both the newest version of smash and that it was released on the Nintendo switch which has sold about 84 million copies so far. However gameplay is also a crucial factor in its success. Ultimate is both faster than the previous title smash 4 and “less” technical then melee. Less is of course subjective, but the removal of wave dashing and other such mechanics. Will make it less daunting to get into</p>

<p id="para_2">Ultimate is for now the biggest crossover of various gaming franchises. The game has a cast of 88 Currently and one mor character is on its way but yet to revealed. For people who’ve never played the game it can be intimidating especially if  you’ve never played a fighting game however ultimate unlike most of fighting games doesn’t have a lot of complex inputs for most of the cast. The standard moveset for each character uses directional inputs. Directional inputs mean you only have to input one direction and either b, a, or a whilst in the air. These allow you to access unique move for your character. Smash seems very simple from how I described it but it still is a very complicated game which is why both ventures of the smash series and new players can enjoy the game. It can be a game played with crowds roaring as a pro player makes a incredible play or you and your friends enjoying playing on the couch. It true is a game meant for all to be enjoyed
